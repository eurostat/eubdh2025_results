# NTTS Hackathon 2025, French NSI team submission: CLC+ Delta, a dashboard for land use change

## Content

This folder includes our two repo as submodules.
The "model" folder contains everything you need to set up, train and use our model replicating Corine Land Cover Plus, as well as the slides for the hackathon's pitch.
The README in the "model" folder provides more information on the project.

In the "dashboard" folder you'll find the code for the dashboard. We use GitHub Pages to produce one web page per repo (one for the slides, one for the dashboard). GitHub Pages might not work in the submodules as it was intended in the original repos.
