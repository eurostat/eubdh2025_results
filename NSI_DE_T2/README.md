<img src="dashboard/data/EU_Quokka_Logo.png" alt="EU Quokka logo" width="300">


The EU Quokka dashboard focuses on providing EU-wide indicators to assess the local quality of life. To provide the local view, the EUROSTAT 1km x 1km grid is used as the base entities on which different indicators on quality of life are provided. 

The dashboard covers different main themes that are relevant to the quality of life for the local population, like access to green areas in their surroundings and monitoring the air quality. Users can explore the provided indicators in the dedicated areas on the dashboard.

Our application focuses on two NUTS-2 regions: DEA1: Germany -DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) and IE05: Ireland - Eastern and Midland. 


### Folder structure
